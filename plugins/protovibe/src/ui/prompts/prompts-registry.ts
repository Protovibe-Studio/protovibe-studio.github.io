  Before writing any code:
  1. Read plugins/protovibe/PROTOVIBE_AGENTS.md and \`src/App.tsx\` to understand how views are mounted and how the app is structured.
  2. This app uses querystring-based routing (e.g. \`?view=xxx\`). Add the new route by following the existing pattern exactly — do NOT introduce react-router or any other routing library. Consider using queryStrings for dialogs also (separate key for each dialog like employeeDialog=true (so that visible dialog layer gets it's own key set to true, but don't set the key to false for non visible dialogs, just remove the key from URL).
  3. Browse \`src/components/ui/\` and reuse existing components wherever possible. Only write custom HTML/Tailwind when no existing component fits the need.
  4. Use mock data held in React state (e.g. \`useState\` with a seeded default). The data should persist while navigating within the app but reset on full page refresh — do not write to localStorage, files, or any backend.

  Enrich the selected markup with Protovibe editable blocks. The goal is to wrap every independently-editable element with the correct pv-editable-zone / pv-block comment tags and \`data-pv-block\` attributes so the user can move, reorder, and delete them on the canvas.

  Target element: data-pv-block="{{blockId}}" (lines {{startLine}}–{{endLine}})
  File: \`{{file}}\`

  Current source:
  \`\`\`tsx
  {{code}}
  \`\`\`

  Before writing any code, read plugins/protovibe/PROTOVIBE_AGENTS.md end-to-end — especially the "Creating New Views and Elements" section covering pv-editable-zone / pv-block IDs, block granularity, and the rule for wrapping conditionally-rendered elements and exposing props on components.

  Guidelines:
  - Do NOT change markup structure, props, styling, or behavior. This task ONLY inserts the pv comment tags and \`data-pv-block\` attributes.
  - Assign a fresh random 6-character alphanumeric ID to every zone and block you introduce. The ID on the comment tags MUST match the \`data-pv-block\` attribute on the root element.
  - Be granular: whatever can be reordered, should be wrapped in a block, even single a hrefs, every direct sibling inside a zone that a user might reorder, delete, or edit independently gets its own pv-block — including dividers and small visual separators. Don't collapse a whole section into one block.
  - **Container blocks need inner zones too.** If a block's root element contains multiple independently-editable children (e.g. a label + an input field, a heading + a paragraph), add a \`pv-editable-zone\` inside the root element and give each child its own \`pv-block\`. Without this inner zone the children cannot be deleted or reordered on the canvas. This rule applies equally to compound components (e.g. \`SelectDropdown\` with \`DropdownItem\` children) — do not treat them as atomic just because they share a semantic purpose; if the children can be reordered or deleted independently, they each need a \`pv-block\` inside an inner zone.

    ❌ BAD — label and input collapsed, no inner zone:
    \`\`\`jsx
    {/* pv-block-start:a1b2c3 */}
    <div data-pv-block="a1b2c3" className="flex flex-col gap-2">
      <TextParagraph typography="semibold-primary">Hello world</TextParagraph>
      <Input defaultValue="Python" />
    </div>
    {/* pv-block-end:a1b2c3 */}
    \`\`\`

    ✅ GOOD — inner zone exposes each child as its own block:
    \`\`\`jsx
    {/* pv-block-start:a1b2c3 */}
    <div data-pv-block="a1b2c3" className="flex flex-col gap-2">
      {/* pv-editable-zone-start:z9x8y7 */}
        {/* pv-block-start:f2a8k1 */}
        <TextParagraph data-pv-block="f2a8k1" typography="semibold-primary">Hello world</TextParagraph>
        {/* pv-block-end:f2a8k1 */}
        {/* pv-block-start:j7c3p9 */}
        <Input data-pv-block="j7c3p9" defaultValue="Python" />
        {/* pv-block-end:j7c3p9 */}
      {/* pv-editable-zone-end:z9x8y7 */}
    </div>
    {/* pv-block-end:a1b2c3 */}
    \`\`\`

  - Elements rendered conditionally (e.g. \`{cond && <X />}\`) or via short logic like \`{items.map(...)}\` can still be wrapped. Place the pv-block-start / pv-block-end comment tags *outside* the \`{...}\` expression so the whole conditional (including its braces) moves as one unit. See the "Wrap Conditionally-Rendered Elements Around the Logic" rule in plugins/protovibe/PROTOVIBE_AGENTS.md.
  - Preserve any existing pv tags and IDs already present in the selection. Only add new ones where they are missing.
  - Pay attention to braces - these are normal comment tags, normal JSX comments with SINGLE braces, not template literals — do not accidentally wrap them in double braces

  Conversion rules:
  - Preserve the intent of the sketch's styling, visual hierarchy, and element ordering.
  - The sketchpad uses absolute positioning for layout. Convert every \`position: absolute\` / top/left/width/height placement into normal document flow using Flexbox, Grid, padding, margin, and gap. Infer reasonable spacing values from the visual gaps in the sketch.
  - Replace sketch-only primitives like "rectangle" with the proper components from \`@/components/ui/\` where equivalents exist.
  - Rebuild the pv-block / pv-editable-zone structure with granular blocks per the plugins/protovibe/PROTOVIBE_AGENTS.md conventions so the result is editable in the normal app canvas.
  - Keep text content identical to the sketch unless the user asks otherwise.
  - Add any interactions or dynamic behavior needed to make this a real, working part of the app — but do not add extra features beyond what the user asked for.

  - Keep only the visual structure and representative text/content. Hard-code any data that was dynamic.
  - Use normal document flow for layout (Flexbox/Grid/padding/gap). Do NOT use \`position: absolute\` even though this is going into the sketchpad.
  - Follow the sketchpad styling conventions used by the other files in \`src/sketchpad/\` (or wherever sketchpads live in this project) — read a couple before writing.
  - Wrap the result in pv-editable-zone / pv-block tags with HIGH granularity: every direct child the user might want to reorder, delete, or edit independently must be its own pv-block with a fresh 6-char id. Err on the side of more blocks rather than fewer.

  3.

  Source code of the selection:
  \`\`\`tsx
  {{code}}
  \`\`\`
  
  Before writing any code:
  1. Read the "Components Editing" section of plugins/protovibe/PROTOVIBE_AGENTS.md end-to-end — every new file MUST conform (pvConfig, data-pv-component-id, PvDefaultContent, static Tailwind strings, safe prop types, semantic tokens, ...props on root).
  2. READ several existing files in \`src/components/ui/\` before writing anything — at minimum button.tsx, card.tsx, textblock.tsx, and one compound component like tabs.tsx or select.tsx. Match their prop naming, typing, file layout, variant handling, and \`pvConfig\` shape. Do not guess structure from memory.
  
  How to infer the component API:
  - If the selection contains MULTIPLE variants of the same thing (e.g. two cards where one has an icon and one does not, or three buttons with different colors and sizes), DIFF them to figure out which parts vary. Each varying aspect becomes a prop:
    • differing strings → \`string\` props (label, heading, description…)
    • differing booleans (present/absent elements) → \`boolean\` props
    • differing sets of discrete values (color, size, layout) → \`select\` props with the observed values as options
  - Everything that is identical across variants becomes hard-coded structure inside the component.
  - Expose only \`string\` / \`boolean\` / \`select\` props via \`pvConfig.props\`. Never expose functions, children, or asChild.
  - Add \`invalidCombinations\` filters for any prop combinations that would obviously break visually. 
  - Don't add default values to text props in prop definition like this: icon = 'mdi:star', heading = 'Feature', - rather you should specify in pvConfig the exampleValues for each prop
  
  Decomposition — when to create more than one component:
  - If the selection is non-atomic (parent + repeated or swappable children the user will want to reorder, delete, or edit independently — e.g. a tab strip with triggers and panels, a dropdown with items, a sidebar with nav links), split it into multiple components in separate files, each with its own \`pvConfig\`, EXACTLY the way \`tabs.tsx\` / \`select.tsx\` are structured in this project. Parent owns layout and context; children own their own editable content.
  - Share state between parent and child via React Context (see tabs.tsx for the pattern). Do NOT pass callbacks or controlled state through props that the editor would need to manage.
  - If the selection is a single cohesive atom (e.g. a stat tile, a badge), keep it as one file.
  
  Replacing the original usage:
  - After creating the component(s), replace the selected markup in \`{{file}}\` with calls to the new component(s). Preserve the surrounding pv-editable-zone / pv-block tags and their IDs.
  - For each original variant in the selection, set the props so the rendered output matches the original visually.

  Edit the design tokens in \`src/index.css\`.
  
  Before touching any code, open and read \`src/index.css\` in full so you understand its exact structure. Here is a summary of what you will find:
  
  - \`[data-theme="light"]\` and \`[data-theme="dark"]\` blocks each define raw CSS custom properties (e.g. \`--background-primary\`, \`--foreground-default\`, \`--border-default\`). These are the values to edit.
  - The \`@theme\` block below them maps each raw property to a Tailwind color token via \`var()\` (e.g. \`--color-background-primary: var(--background-primary)\`). Don't forget to add tokens here if you added new CSS variables. 
  - All color values use \`oklch(lightness% chroma hue)\` syntax. Hover/pressed/subtle variants are derived from the base by adjusting lightness and/or chroma; keep the same hue unless the user explicitly asks to change it.
  
  Token groups (edit the ones relevant to the request):
  - **Backgrounds** — \`--background-default/subtle/secondary/tertiary/elevated/strong/overlay/disabled/transparent\` plus accent fills \`--background-primary/destructive/success/warning/info\` and their \`-hover\`/\`-pressed\`/\`-subtle\` variants.
  - **Foregrounds (text)** — \`--foreground-default/secondary/tertiary/strong/disabled/inverse/on-primary/primary/destructive/success/warning/info\`.
  - **Borders** — \`--border-default/secondary/strong/focus/primary/destructive/success/warning/info\`.
  
  Rules:
  - If you edit tokens, edit the raw properties inside \`[data-theme="light"]\` and/or \`[data-theme="dark"]\` 
  - If you add new tokens, also add them to \`@theme\` block
  - Use the exact color value the user provided. Do not convert it to another format.
  - When changing a base color (e.g. \`--background-primary\`), update its \`-hover\`, \`-pressed\`, \`-subtle\`, \`-subtle-hover\`, and \`-subtle-pressed\` variants proportionally: hover = base lightness +5–8%, pressed = base lightness −10–15%, subtle = very high lightness low chroma version of the hue.
  - If the user provides a specific color value without mentioning which theme it targets, assume it is for **light mode**. Derive a matching dark-mode equivalent automatically (typically: invert the lightness curve — light-mode light backgrounds become dark-mode dark backgrounds, and vice versa — while preserving chroma and hue). Then **inform the user** at the start of your response that you assumed light mode for the provided value and auto-generated the dark-mode counterpart, and show both values so they can adjust if needed.
  - If the user explicitly mentions only one theme, apply changes only to that theme and leave the other untouched.`,
