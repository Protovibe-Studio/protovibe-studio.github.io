//
// Registry of prompt templates shown in the Protovibe "Prompts" sidebar tab.
// Edit this file to add, remove, or tweak prompts. Each entry is self-contained
// data — no React, no imports from the UI — so designers can touch it safely.
//
// Template placeholders resolved at copy-time:
//   {{input}}       — free-text the user typed into the textarea
//   {{file}}        — current file path, e.g. "src/pages/Dashboard.tsx"
//   {{startLine}}   — starting line of the current selection
//   {{endLine}}     — ending line of the current selection
//   {{blockId}}     — nearest `data-pv-block` id to the current selection
//   {{code}}        — source code of the currently selected block
//   {{agentsRules}} — standard reminder to follow plugins/protovibe/PROTOVIBE_AGENTS.md rules
//                     (every prompt gets this — if a template omits the
//                      placeholder, it is appended at the end automatically)
//   {{attachments}} — absolute paths of the files attached in the Prompts tab.
//                     Same deal: templates do NOT need this placeholder. When
//                     attachments exist and a template omits it, the block is
//                     appended after the rules reminder.
//
// When a reference is missing (e.g. no selection), the placeholder is
// replaced with a readable fallback like "(no file selected)".

  Create a new view or feature in this Protovibe application.
  
  Before writing any code:
  1. Read plugins/protovibe/PROTOVIBE_AGENTS.md and \`src/App.tsx\` to understand how views are mounted and how the app is structured.
  2. This app uses querystring-based routing (e.g. \`?view=xxx\`). Add the new route by following the existing pattern exactly — do NOT introduce react-router or any other routing library. Consider using queryStrings for dialogs also (separate key for each dialog like employeeDialog=true (so that visible dialog layer gets it's own key set to true, but don't set the key to false for non visible dialogs, just remove the key from URL).
  3. Browse \`src/components/ui/\` and reuse existing components wherever possible. Only write custom HTML/Tailwind when no existing component fits the need.
  4. Use mock data held in React state (e.g. \`useState\` with a seeded default). The data should persist while navigating within the app but reset on full page refresh — do not write to localStorage, files, or any backend.

    template: `Scope from the user:
  {{input}}
  
  I'm a designer and this is a prototype. I want any state of it to be reachable from a URL — a dialog already open, a section expanded, a specific option selected in a dropdown or radio group, a dropdown open, a conditional element already revealed, or a screen sitting in its loading, empty or error state. Make every one of those states deep-linkable through the URL query string, so each one can later be pinned as a state in Protovibe Specs and annotations and handed to developers.
  
  FIRST, before writing any code:
  - If the scope above does not clearly say WHERE to apply this, ASK ME whether you should do it across the whole prototype or only in one selected flow/view — and wait for my answer. Do not guess.
  - Read the "Adding Interaction" and "Deep-linkable UI state" sections of plugins/protovibe/PROTOVIBE_AGENTS.md.
  - Read \`src/store.tsx\` to see how \`state.queryParams\` and \`setQueryParams\` work, and read an existing page that already uses them so you follow the established pattern exactly. Do NOT introduce react-router or any other routing library, and do not invent a new state container.
  
  Then convert the UI state in scope from \`useState\` to the query string:
  1. Inventory every representable state first, then work through it. Walk the files in scope and cover each one: dialogs/drawers/sheets (open or closed), expandable/collapsible sections and accordions, tabs and sub-tabs, selected rows/cards/items, form control values (select, dropdown, radio, checkbox, toggle, segmented control), open/closed dropdown and popover menus, and anything rendered conditionally on another state. Include the states that are normally invisible or fleeting, because those are exactly the ones that are hard to demo otherwise: loading/skeleton states, empty states, error states, success confirmations, and transient UI like a visible toast or an inline "Saved" flash. If a state can be described, it should be reachable from a URL.
  2. Give each state its own query key, in camelCase, named after the thing it controls and scoped by its owner so keys can never collide across views (e.g. \`employeeDialog\`, \`employeeDialogTab\`, \`employeeDialogAddressSection\`, \`billingPlan\`).
  3. Derive the value from \`state.queryParams\` — never from \`useState\` — and always validate it against the allowed values, falling back to the default when the param is missing or invalid. A junk value in a shared link must render the default, not a broken screen.
  4. Write values with \`setQueryParams\`. Booleans use the string \`'true'\` when on and \`null\` (key removed) when off — never \`false\`. Enumerated values (tab, selected option, selected id) store the value itself.
  5. Keep clean URLs: only non-default values appear. Drop the key whenever the state returns to its default, so a bare URL always means "default state".
  6. Decide, per param, whether the change belongs in browser history. A param can be deep-linkable without adding a history entry:
     - Push a history entry for navigational changes the user would expect the Back button to undo — opening a dialog, switching a view or tab, selecting a record.
     - Replace the current entry (\`history.replaceState\`) for transient or incidental params — a toast being shown, a loading/error state being simulated, an open dropdown, a scroll or hover-driven flag, a filter being retyped — so the URL still describes the screen and is still shareable, but the user does not have to press Back ten times to escape.
     - \`setQueryParams\` in \`src/store.tsx\` currently always pushes. Extend it with an optional replace mode (e.g. \`setQueryParams(updates, { replace: true })\`) following its existing structure — same param-diffing, same \`PV_URL_CHANGE\` postMessage to the parent frame, only \`pushState\` swapped for \`replaceState\` — and keep the default behaviour unchanged so existing call sites are unaffected.
  
  Preventing stale params — this is the part that usually goes wrong:
  - Model the params as a tree: a dialog's params (its tab, its expanded sections, its dropdown selections, its open menus) are CHILDREN of the dialog's own param.
  - When a parent closes or is deselected, remove the parent key AND every descendant key in the SAME \`setQueryParams\` call, so no intermediate URL ever exists. Example: closing \`employeeDialog\` must also null out \`employeeDialogTab\`, \`employeeDialogAddressSection\`, and any other key that only makes sense while that dialog is open.
  - Because of that, reopening the dialog starts fresh at its defaults — a section the user expanded last time must NOT come back expanded.
  - The same applies when the selected entity changes (switching to a different record clears that record's per-record sub-state) and when navigating to another view (view-scoped keys are cleared).
  - Centralise this: define the owned child keys for each parent once (e.g. a small constant listing them) and have one close/reset helper clear them, rather than repeating null-ing lists at every call site where it is easy to forget one.
  - Transient states belong in the URL too — a loading flag, a visible toast, an error banner or an open menu is a state I need to be able to link to. Put them in the query string like everything else, just use the replace mode from step 6 so they do not clog history, and make sure they are cleaned up on the same rules as everything else: a simulated loading or error param must be dropped when the screen leaves that state, and a toast param must be dropped when the toast is dismissed or auto-hides, so a stale link never shows a toast that can never go away.
  - The only things to leave out are values that cannot survive a URL: secrets, and anything too large to sit in a query string (raw file contents, large blobs). If you leave something out, say which and why.
  
  Also make sure that:
  - Browser back/forward works and feels sane — every state change goes through \`setQueryParams\`, and the push/replace choice from step 6 keeps Back meaningful instead of stepping through every transient flicker.
  - Every param survives a reload and a fresh paste of the URL into a new tab, including the loading, error and toast ones — state is read from the query string on mount, not just written to it.
  - Compound components (Tabs, RadioGroup, Select) keep using their context-driven API — feed them the value derived from the query param and write the new value back in their change handler. Do not hand-wire selected props onto individual children.
  - Existing behaviour and visuals are unchanged; this is a state-plumbing refactor, not a redesign.
  
  Do not finish by compiling a list of example links for me — just make the states deep-linkable in the code. I will capture the ones I need by navigating the prototype and pinning them as states in Protovibe Specs and annotations, which is exactly why the URL has to describe the screen completely and never carry a stale param.

  Enrich the selected markup with Protovibe editable blocks. The goal is to wrap every independently-editable element with the correct pv-editable-zone / pv-block comment tags and \`data-pv-block\` attributes so the user can move, reorder, and delete them on the canvas.

  \`\`\`

  Before writing any code, read plugins/protovibe/PROTOVIBE_AGENTS.md end-to-end — especially the "Creating New Views and Elements" section covering pv-editable-zone / pv-block IDs, block granularity, and the rule for wrapping conditionally-rendered elements and exposing props on components.

  Guidelines:
  - Do NOT change markup structure, props, styling, or behavior. This task ONLY inserts the pv comment tags and \`data-pv-block\` attributes.
  - Assign a fresh random 6-character alphanumeric ID to every zone and block you introduce. The ID on the comment tags MUST match the \`data-pv-block\` attribute on the root element.
  - Be granular: whatever can be reordered, should be wrapped in a block, even single a hrefs, every direct sibling inside a zone that a user might reorder, delete, or edit independently gets its own pv-block — including dividers and small visual separators. Don't collapse a whole section into one block.
  - **Container blocks need inner zones too.** If a block's root element contains multiple independently-editable children (e.g. a label + an input field, a heading + a paragraph), add a \`pv-editable-zone\` inside the root element and give each child its own \`pv-block\`. Without this inner zone the children cannot be deleted or reordered on the canvas. This rule applies equally to compound components (e.g. \`SelectDropdown\` with \`DropdownItem\` children) — do not treat them as atomic just because they share a semantic purpose; if the children can be reordered or deleted independently, they each need a \`pv-block\` inside an inner zone.

    ❌ BAD — label and input collapsed, no inner zone:
    \`\`\`jsx
    {/* pv-block-start:a1b2c3 */}
    <div data-pv-block="a1b2c3" className="flex flex-col gap-2">
      <TextParagraph typography="semibold-primary">Hello world</TextParagraph>
      <Input defaultValue="Python" />
    </div>
    {/* pv-block-end:a1b2c3 */}
    \`\`\`

    ✅ GOOD — inner zone exposes each child as its own block:
    \`\`\`jsx
    {/* pv-block-start:a1b2c3 */}
    <div data-pv-block="a1b2c3" className="flex flex-col gap-2">
      {/* pv-editable-zone-start:z9x8y7 */}
        {/* pv-block-start:f2a8k1 */}
        <TextParagraph data-pv-block="f2a8k1" typography="semibold-primary">Hello world</TextParagraph>
        {/* pv-block-end:f2a8k1 */}
        {/* pv-block-start:j7c3p9 */}
        <Input data-pv-block="j7c3p9" defaultValue="Python" />
        {/* pv-block-end:j7c3p9 */}
      {/* pv-editable-zone-end:z9x8y7 */}
    </div>
    {/* pv-block-end:a1b2c3 */}
    \`\`\`

  - Elements rendered conditionally (e.g. \`{cond && <X />}\`) or via short logic like \`{items.map(...)}\` can still be wrapped. Place the pv-block-start / pv-block-end comment tags *outside* the \`{...}\` expression so the whole conditional (including its braces) moves as one unit. See the "Wrap Conditionally-Rendered Elements Around the Logic" rule in plugins/protovibe/PROTOVIBE_AGENTS.md.
  - Preserve any existing pv tags and IDs already present in the selection. Only add new ones where they are missing.
  - Pay attention to braces - these are normal comment tags, normal JSX comments with SINGLE braces, not template literals — do not accidentally wrap them in double braces

  - Replace sketch-only primitives like "rectangle" with the proper components from \`@/components/ui/\` where equivalents exist.
  - Rebuild the pv-block / pv-editable-zone structure with granular blocks per the plugins/protovibe/PROTOVIBE_AGENTS.md conventions so the result is editable in the normal app canvas.
  - Keep text content identical to the sketch unless the user asks otherwise.
  - Add any interactions or dynamic behavior needed to make this a real, working part of the app — but do not add extra features beyond what the user asked for.

  - Use normal document flow for layout (Flexbox/Grid/padding/gap). Do NOT use \`position: absolute\` even though this is going into the sketchpad.
  - Follow the sketchpad styling conventions used by the other files in \`src/sketchpad/\` (or wherever sketchpads live in this project) — read a couple before writing.
  - Wrap the result in pv-editable-zone / pv-block tags with HIGH granularity: every direct child the user might want to reorder, delete, or edit independently must be its own pv-block with a fresh 6-char id. Err on the side of more blocks rather than fewer.

Match their prop naming, typing, file layout, variant handling, and \`pvConfig\` shape. Do not guess structure from memory.
  
  How to infer the component API:
  - If the selection contains MULTIPLE variants of the same thing (e.g. two cards where one has an icon and one does not, or three buttons with different colors and sizes), DIFF them to figure out which parts vary. Each varying aspect becomes a prop:
    • differing strings → \`string\` props (label, heading, description…)
    • differing booleans (present/absent elements) → \`boolean\` props
    • differing sets of discrete values (color, size, layout) → \`select\` props with the observed values as options
  - Everything that is identical across variants becomes hard-coded structure inside the component.
  - Expose only \`string\` / \`boolean\` / \`select\` props via \`pvConfig.props\`. Never expose functions, children, or asChild.
  - Add \`invalidCombinations\` filters for any prop combinations that would obviously break visually. 
  - Don't add default values to text props in prop definition like this: icon = 'mdi:star', heading = 'Feature', - rather you should specify in pvConfig the exampleValues for each prop
  
  Decomposition — when to create more than one component:
  - If the selection is non-atomic (parent + repeated or swappable children the user will want to reorder, delete, or edit independently — e.g. a tab strip with triggers and panels, a dropdown with items, a sidebar with nav links), split it into multiple components in separate files, each with its own \`pvConfig\`, EXACTLY the way \`tabs.tsx\` / \`select.tsx\` are structured in this project. Parent owns layout and context; children own their own editable content.
  - Share state between parent and child via React Context (see tabs.tsx for the pattern). Do NOT pass callbacks or controlled state through props that the editor would need to manage.
  - If the selection is a single cohesive atom (e.g. a stat tile, a badge), keep it as one file.
  
  Replacing the original usage:
  - After creating the component(s), replace the selected markup in \`{{file}}\` with calls to the new component(s). Preserve the surrounding pv-editable-zone / pv-block tags and their IDs.
  - For each original variant in the selection, set the props so the rendered output matches the original visually.

  Before writing any code, read plugins/protovibe/PROTOVIBE_AGENTS.md end-to-end. Then figure out which component in \`src/components/ui/\` renders this element (follow the import in \`{{file}}\` if needed, or match by the \`data-pv-component-id\` attribute). Then apply the requested change to that component's source file.
  
  Requirements:
  - Respect every rule in plugins/protovibe/PROTOVIBE_AGENTS.md — especially: one pvConfig per file, explicit data-pv-component-id, safe prop types, static Tailwind class strings, semantic color tokens, and \`...props\` spread on the root element.
  - If the change introduces a new variant/prop, add it to \`pvConfig.props\` and add any needed \`invalidCombinations\` filters.
  - Keep existing usages working — do not rename or remove props unless the user asked for it.
  - If needed update the consumer files

  Edit the design tokens in \`src/index.css\`.
  
  Before touching any code, open and read \`src/index.css\` in full so you understand its exact structure. Here is a summary of what you will find:
  
  - \`[data-theme="light"]\` and \`[data-theme="dark"]\` blocks each define raw CSS custom properties (e.g. \`--background-primary\`, \`--foreground-default\`, \`--border-default\`). These are the values to edit.
  - The \`@theme\` block below them maps each raw property to a Tailwind color token via \`var()\` (e.g. \`--color-background-primary: var(--background-primary)\`). Don't forget to add tokens here if you added new CSS variables. 
  - All color values use \`oklch(lightness% chroma hue)\` syntax. Hover/pressed/subtle variants are derived from the base by adjusting lightness and/or chroma; keep the same hue unless the user explicitly asks to change it.
  
  Token groups (edit the ones relevant to the request):
  - **Backgrounds** — \`--background-default/subtle/secondary/tertiary/elevated/strong/overlay/disabled/transparent\` plus accent fills \`--background-primary/destructive/success/warning/info\` and their \`-hover\`/\`-pressed\`/\`-subtle\` variants.
  - **Foregrounds (text)** — \`--foreground-default/secondary/tertiary/strong/disabled/inverse/on-primary/primary/destructive/success/warning/info\`.
  - **Borders** — \`--border-default/secondary/strong/focus/primary/destructive/success/warning/info\`.
  
  Rules:
  - If you edit tokens, edit the raw properties inside \`[data-theme="light"]\` and/or \`[data-theme="dark"]\` 
  - If you add new tokens, also add them to \`@theme\` block
  - Use the exact color value the user provided. Do not convert it to another format.
  - When changing a base color (e.g. \`--background-primary\`), update its \`-hover\`, \`-pressed\`, \`-subtle\`, \`-subtle-hover\`, and \`-subtle-pressed\` variants proportionally: hover = base lightness +5–8%, pressed = base lightness −10–15%, subtle = very high lightness low chroma version of the hue.
  - If the user provides a specific color value without mentioning which theme it targets, assume it is for **light mode**. Derive a matching dark-mode equivalent automatically (typically: invert the lightness curve — light-mode light backgrounds become dark-mode dark backgrounds, and vice versa — while preserving chroma and hue). Then **inform the user** at the start of your response that you assumed light mode for the provided value and auto-generated the dark-mode counterpart, and show both values so they can adjust if needed.
  - If the user explicitly mentions only one theme, apply changes only to that theme and leave the other untouched.
